To run Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric, follow below instructions.

Below instructions will help you in setting up Network on Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Composer and running Rest Server. 


The following are prerequisites for installing the required tools:

->Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
->Docker Engine: Version 17.03 or higher
->Docker-Compose: Version 1.8 or higher
->Node: 8.9 or higher (note version 9 is not supported)
->npm: v5.x
->git: 2.9.x or higher
->Python: 2.7.x
**If installing Hyperledger Composer using Linux, be aware of the following advice:

Login as a normal user, rather than root.
Do not su to root.
When installing prerequisites, use curl, then unzip using sudo.
Run prereqs-ubuntu.sh as a normal user. It may prompt for root password as some of it's actions are required to be run as root.
Do not use npm with sudo or su to root to use it.
Avoid installing node globally as root.**
If you're running on Ubuntu, you can download the prerequisites using the following commands:

       curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/prereqs-ubuntu.sh

       chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh

Next run the script - as this briefly uses sudo during its execution, you will be prompted for your password.

       ./prereqs-ubuntu.sh


Step 1: Install the CLI tools
There are a few useful CLI tools for Composer developers. The most important one is composer-cli, which contains all the essential operations, so we'll install that first. Next, we'll also pick up generator-hyperledger-composer, composer-rest-server and Yeoman plus the generator-hyperledger-composer.

Note that you should not use su or sudo for the following npm commands.

  1.Essential CLI tools:

	npm install -g composer-cli@0.19

  2.Utility for running a REST Server on your machine to expose your business networks as RESTful APIs:

	npm install -g composer-rest-server@0.19

  3.Useful utility for generating application assets:

	npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@0.19

  4.Yeoman is a tool for generating applications, which utilises generator-hyperledger-composer:

	npm install -g yo


Step 4: Install Hyperledger Fabric
This step gives you a local/cloud Hyperledger Fabric runtime to deploy your business networks to.

In a directory of your choice (we will assume ~/fabric-dev-servers), get the .tar.gz file that contains the tools to install Hyperledger Fabric:

	mkdir ~/fabric-dev-servers && cd ~/fabric-dev-servers

	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
tar -xvf fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz 

A zip is also available if you prefer: just replace the .tar.gz file with fabric-dev-servers.zip and the tar -xvf command with a unzip command in the preceding snippet.

	cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
	export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv11
	./downloadFabric.sh


Starting and stopping Hyperledger Fabric
You control your runtime using a set of scripts which you'll find in ~/fabric-dev-servers if you followed the suggested defaults.

The first time you start up a new runtime, you'll need to run the start script, then generate a PeerAdmin card:

       cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
       export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv11
       ./startFabric.sh
       ./createPeerAdminCard.sh

At the end of your development session, you run ~/fabric-dev-servers/stopFabric.sh and then ~/fabric-dev-servers/teardownFabric.sh. Note that if you've run the teardown script, the next time you start the runtime, you'll need to create a new PeerAdmin card just like you did on first time startup.


-------------Deploying the business network-----------------------

Deploying a business network to the Hyperledger Fabric requires the Hyperledger Composer business network to be installed on the peer, then the business network can be started, and a new participant, identity, and associated card must be created to be the network administrator. Finally, the network administrator business network card must be imported for use, and the network can then be pinged to check it is responding.

Retrieving the correct credentials:
A PeerAdmin business network card with the correct credentials is already created as part of environment installation.

  1.To install the business network run the following command:

	composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile primechain-kyc@0.0.11.bna

  2.The composer network install command requires a PeerAdmin business network card (in this case one has been created and imported in advance), and the the file path of the .bna which defines the business network.

	composer network start --networkName primechain-kyc --networkVersion 0.0.11 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1


The composer network start command requires a business network card, as well as the name of the admin identity for the business network, the name and version of the business network and the name of the file to be created ready to import as a business network card.

  3.To import the network administrator identity as a usable business network card, run the following command:

	composer card import --file admin@primechain-kyc.card

  4.To check that the business network has been deployed successfully, run the following command to ping the network:

	composer network ping --card admin@primechain-kyc

The composer network ping command requires a business network card to identify the network to ping.


--------------STARTING THE REST SERVER------------------


Hyperledger Composer can generate a bespoke REST API based on a business network. Below is the command to run the rest server. 

	composer-rest-server  -P [port-number]

  a.Enter admin@primechain-kyc as the card name.

  b.Select never use namespaces when asked whether to use namespaces in the generated API.

  c.Select No when asked whether to secure the generated API.(you can use it as per your need) 

  c.Select Yes when asked whether to enable event publication.

  c.Select No when asked whether to enable TLS security.


The generated API is connected to the deployed blockchain and business network.




----------------Network setting up is now done with one peer, one ordered, one Certification Authority with Rest Server--------------------------
